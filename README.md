Website-Portfolio


What is your website about? is it directed to a particular field or industry?

My website is a comprehensive showcase of my academic and professional portfolio, primarily focused on the intersection of academia and the IT industry. It features a diverse range of projects and research that I have undertaken during my university studies, as well as any relevant work experiences. The content is tailored to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in various domains within the IT sector, including software development, data analysis, and cybersecurity, among others.


Audience. Who are your visitors and what information will they be looking for?

The primary audience for my website includes my lecturers and professors, who can see the practical application of their teachings in my work; potential employers or recruiters in the IT industry, who may be looking for a candidate with my skill set and academic background; and fellow students or peers, who might be interested in collaborating on projects or seeking inspiration for their own work. Visitors can expect to find detailed information about my academic projects, technical skills, any relevant work experiences, and my contact information for potential collaborations or job opportunities.

What existing websites perform a similar function?

Examples might include platforms like Behance or Dribbble for designers, GitHub for developers to showcase their coding projects, or LinkedIn for a more general professional profile. Personal websites of other professionals in the IT field can also be a good reference. 


Here are my prototypes which I made in Figma, it shows the idea of the website: 
This is the main-home page:

This is the page which shows one of my projects more detailed, each of my project have separate page:

The concept of dark and light modes in user interfaces was developed for several reasons, addressing both user experience and practical considerations:

1. Eye Comfort and Reduced Eye Strain: Dark mode is often preferred in low-light environments as it reduces the amount of bright light emitted by screens, which can cause eye strain. Light text on a dark background can be easier on the eyes in these conditions, making reading and screen usage more comfortable over extended periods.
2. Energy Conservation: On devices with OLED or AMOLED screens, dark mode can help conserve battery life. These screen types can turn off individual pixels when displaying black, which means dark mode can reduce power consumption as more pixels remain off or dimmer.
3. Aesthetic and Personal Preference: Some users simply prefer the aesthetic of dark mode, finding it more visually appealing or less distracting. It provides an alternative look and feel that can be more conducive to focus and concentration for some individuals.
4. Accessibility: Dark mode can be beneficial for users with certain visual impairments or sensitivities. For example, people with light sensitivity or certain visual impairments may find dark mode less harsh and easier to navigate.
5. Reducing Blue Light Exposure: Dark mode can reduce the exposure to blue light emitted by screens, which is believed to affect sleep patterns by disrupting the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles.

The option to switch between dark and light modes gives users the flexibility to choose the interface that works best for their needs and preferences, whether it's based on the time of day, lighting conditions, or personal comfort.
So this is the reason why I have decided to do it.

Futhermore, I have maade a phone mode. Phones often have special modes to improve accessibility, such as larger text, high contrast, or voice control for individuals with visual, hearing, or physical impairments. So my website can be accessed by any phone, laptop or other digital screen.
